.SH NAME
leptonica \- image processing library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <leptonica/allheaders.h>
.sp
cc file.c 
.B -llept
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B leptonica
image processing library.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBLeptonica\fP is a well-tested C library for some basic image
processing operations, along with a description of the functions and
some design methods. A full set of affine transformations
(translation, shear, rotation, scaling) on images of all depths is
included, with the exception that some of the scaling methods do not
work at all depths. There are also implementations of binary
morphology, grayscale morphology, convolution and rank order filters,
and applications such as jbig2 image processing and color
quantization. You will also find basic utilities for the safe and
efficient handling of arrays (of strings, numbers, number pairs and
image-related geometrical objects), byte queues, generic stacks,
generic lists, and endian-independent indexing into 32-bit arrays.

.SH OPTIONS
Most example programs included with leptonica will report their usage if
you try to run them on the command line with no arguments. Usage varies
from program to program. These are sample programs; read their source 
code if you are trying to do something similar.
